# Tool Set v2.3

This directory contains the tool set in the version 2.3.

Please note that we provide a [JSON file](additional_config_tools.json), which can be used to supply API keys and other configuration parameters to the respective tools.
For the current version 2.3 of the tool set, no such configuration is necessary.
However we left the file in place to illustrate its use, in case you want to develop or use your own tool set.
